= AWARE Micro

This is the new AWARE server for conducting studies using AWARE. It is a reactive, non-blocking server able to handle thousands of requests per second on a single machine.

This can be run on any OS as it is a JVM server implementation. This server is built using image:https://img.shields.io/badge/vert.x-3.8.4-purple.svg[link="https://vertx.io"]. It is compatible with the existing AWARE clients.

#This is not compatible with the old dashboard located at api.awareframework.com. We are working on a new front-end to interface with AWARE Micro deployments.#

== Deploying server

The only dependency you need on your server is having Java (OpenJDK) installed.

For Debian/Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install default-jdk
```

For CentOS/Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install java-latest-openjdk-devel
```

Set the default Java compiler to the latest JDK and choose the JDK, not JRE.

Debian/Ubuntu
```
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

CentOS/Fedora
```
sudo alternatives --config java
```

== Getting the server code

Make sure you have Git installed on your server:

For Debian/Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install git
```

For CentOS/Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install git
```

Check out the latest source code of the server
```
git clone https://github.com/denzilferreira/aware-micro.git
```

== Running the server

```
cd aware-micro
./gradlew clean build shadowJar
```

This will build and create .jar file in build/libs. Change to this directory and run the server for the first time:
```
cd build/libs
java -jar micro-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar
```
This will create a file aware-config.json. Press CTRL+C to stop your server. You can edit this file to configure what database will be used and port, encryption and sensor & plugin settings for your study.

== Deploy the study
Once you are happy with the configuration, you can keep your server active by creating a screen and running the instance inside that screen.
```
screen
java -jar micro-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar
```
